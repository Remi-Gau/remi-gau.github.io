- good to have many teams analyse the same data
  - less issues of getting it "wrong" especially when new to the field

- good to know that the work will be published no matter what you find. Gee that must be how people who do a registered report feel like. I mean imagine that: knowing that your effort will be rewarded without having to rely on the powers of the allmighty gods of analytical flexibility to find something worth publishing in your heap of data.

Sure the idea of having an "easy" paper out is attractive and I would be a hypocrite to deny that it did not play a role in me wanting to participate in this, but knowing your results will be out there and that if they are completely out of whack with the rest of the teams this might make you look like a big dumb doofy doof. So even for the most cynical out there there is still a push to do well unless they wanna burn any kind scientific street cred they might have.

- pre-reg can speed up your work
- so can using standard data structure
- but if followed "blindly", don't run robustness checks to see if results hold under different pipeline

- nice to have hypothesis for once

- incremental pre-reg: check behavior and quality control to refine your pipeline but without looking at activations.

 - standard pipelines like fMRIprep remove many researchers DOF

- should have run some other pipelines or do a mini-multiverse analysis but you still need a way to choose

- should have run analysis on a couple of subjects and then decide on one pipeline
-  - including model comparison with the MACS toolbox

- should have had a less stringent inferential approach (esp wrt volume for GLM: use union of all the ROIs)
