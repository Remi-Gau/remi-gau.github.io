Apparently when you live code at a conference,
you may get a lot of questions on... your VS-code set up:

> "Why is your screen on fire?"

> "How can you view your brain images directly in the IDE?"

I was asked to make a list and I always do what I am told,
so here we go in no particular order.

<!-- more -->

- [niivue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KorbinianEckstein.niivue) to directly view you brain images when you click on them

- [power-mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode) to add flames, sparkles or fireworks to your cursor as you are typing. You can also add a combo tracker to keep track of long typing streaks and many other completely useless but very cool usual effects.

- [vscode-pets](https://tonybaloney.github.io/vscode-pets/source/_static/throw-ball.gif) if you are running something that less time than it takes to make coffee, don't go on social media, but play catch with your virtual pet in your IDE.
