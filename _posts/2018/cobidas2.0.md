I do have a thing for lists: I have pretty much zero confidence in my memory so in general lists make my life easier because then I don't have to remember everything.

I won't talk of those lists that have contain all those books (I am looking at you Goodreads) and papers (I have a PDF hoarding problem), projects I want work on, trips I want to do but don't have enough money for: those lists usually just make my life more miserable.

One checklist that I have been using almost systematically when writing or reading neuroimaging papers is the one contained in the COBIDAS report regarding methods and results reporting in MRI research. I had always assumed that most people who do MRI and fMRI had heard about this report. Optimist-me thought that most researchers also want to transparently and thoroughly report a) what they have done so that others can try to replicate their work, b) their results so that they can be properly evaluated by the readers. Pessimist-me thought that given the levels of "cookbook approach" to methods and statistics that
Even more so when it came to those researchers who are active on twitter given the high density of "methodological terrorists" on this social network.

So I pretty much assumed that that this little (and completely unrepresentative) twitter poll about COBIDAS would be a completely uninformative home run.

Apparently I was wrong. So maybe it is time we talk of the COBIDAS report and also of what could be done with it.

### In the previous episodes

For the past 10 years there have been several papers (or blog posts) pointing out the problems the low quality of methods and results reporting in neuroimaging. In order to try to set some standards these papers were usually associated with "best practices" to follow in the hope of improving things.

This can be useful for some metascience project: can be a tool to create databasis to investigate changes in reporting across time: e.g multiple comparison before and after the salmon kerfuffle?

The latest and most comprehensive effort is the COBIDAS


report from the OHBM

that was crowdsourced by several experts in the field and came up with a set of guidelines to follow when reporting methods and results for MRI and fMRI studies. There is currently a similar initiative for MEG and EEG.

To make it easier to use and facilitate its implementation the report was accompanied by a checklist at the end.



This report came out ???? years ago
