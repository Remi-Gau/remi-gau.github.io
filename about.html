      <p>
        I have a background both in biology and psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did my PhD studying the role of serotoninergic neurons
        in the interplay between pain and cardio-vascular regulations in rodents.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then moved on to the field of cognitive neuroimaging to study multisensory integration in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about open science that I see as:
        <ul>
          <li>a way to build a more inclusive research community based on sharing
            and cooperation rather than hoarding and competition,</li>
          <li>a way to address some of the replicability and reproducibility issues
            that are affecting many areas of science by making the sharing of code and data more common,</li>
          <li>a set of tools and practices that can reduce inefficiencies
            in the research process and can benefit the overall community
            as well as the individual scientists.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also one of the maintainers of:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html" target="_blank">Nilearn</a> the main python package for machine learning and visualization in neuroImaging.</li>
          <li>the Brain imaging data structure (<a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">BIDS - a standard to help organize and share neuroimaging data)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab" target="_blank">BIDS-matlab</a></li>
        </ul>
        and actively involved in 2 projects aimed at standardizing the reporting of methods
        and resulting in neuroimaging:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728" target="_blank">COBIDAS</a></li>
