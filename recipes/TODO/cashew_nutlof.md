*I used *Better than Bouillon *(vegetarian no chicken soup base) because I didn't have yeast extract. Don't think it's crucial -- whatever you have on hand should suffice.*

*If you are leaving your nut roast to eat cold the next day I would use 1/2 cup of carrot stock as overnight the breadcrumbs tend to absorb some of the moisture causing it to be a *little* drier. *
