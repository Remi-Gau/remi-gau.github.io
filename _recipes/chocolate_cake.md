**Chocolate cake**
4 oz Plain Choc

1/2 pint milk

4 oz Demarara sugar

Melt these ingredients in a jug over a boiling pan of water. Leave to cool.

In your largest bowl cream together....

4 oz butter

4 oz caster sugar then add 2 large egg yokes

Sift together...

1 tsp bicarb

8oz self raising flour

Mix your dry and 'wet' ingredients together in your 'cream' bowl.

2 egg whites : whisk stiff and add to the mixture with a metal spoon. I find its best to leave a very little bit to add to the mixture at the bottom as it is always difficult to get the whites all the way through the mixture.

Stick in two greased/papered tins in an oven for about an hour or the usual springiness but you will know yours best.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Icing</span>

3 oz plain choc powder

4 oz butter

12 oz icing sugar

1/4 pint milk

Melt the butter in a large pan, stir in the coco and cock for a couple of min. Add the icing sugar a bit at a time and milk as needed but as little as possible.

It takes a little while and you might feel like your arm will come off but you get there eventually. The more milk you have the more silky it will become so you might want a slightly different texture in the middle than the outside.
