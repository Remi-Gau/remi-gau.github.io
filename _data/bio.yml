  bio: |
    TL;DR: I started as a biologist who wanted to understand how the brain works,
    now I tell people how to name files, folders and variables.

    I am a research associate in the [Origami lab](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) at the McGill university (Montreal, Quebec, Canada).
    I have a background both in biology and psychology.
    I did my PhD studying the role of serotoninergic neurons in the interplay between pain and cardio-vascular regulations in rodents.
    I then moved on to the field of cognitive neuroimaging to study multisensory integration in humans.
    I am passionate about open science that I see as
    - a) a way to build a more inclusive research community based on sharing and cooperation rather than hoarding and competition,
    - b) a way to address some of the replicability and reproducibility issues that are affecting many areas of science by making the sharing of code and data more common,
    - c) a set of tools and practices that can reduce inefficiencies in the research process and can benefit the overall community as well as the individual scientists.
    I am also one of the maintainers of:
    - Nilearn (the main python package for machine learning and visualization in neuroImaging); https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html
    - the Brain imaging data structure (BIDS - a standard to help organize and share neuroimaging data; https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
    - BIDS-matlab (https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab)
    and actively involved in 2 projects aimed at standardizing the reporting of methods and resulting in neuroimaging:
    - COBIDAS (https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728)
    - ARTEM-IS (https://osf.io/pvrn6/).
